We just made a big change to how we handle Hugo projects and introduced a few new features that make it easier to stay organized.

## Hugo Support for All Versions 🔥🔥🔥

Hugo has a great developer community that is constantly pushing new versions out. Until now you sometimes had to wait a few months until you were able to use the latest version of Hugo with Forestry as we were trying to catch up.

We now support all Hugo versions from the moment they are released.

## Sort Pages by Title 📝 or Date 📅

We used to sort your pages and posts by the last edited date. A lot of you have told us that's not always ideal. Now you can sort your pages by Title and by Date depending on your needs.

## Separate Categories for Front Matter Templates and Partials 👀

With the [Blocks](/docs/settings/fields/blocks/) building feature we introduced [Partial Front Matter Templates](/docs/settings/front-matter-templates/#partial-templates). They can't be used like regular Front Matter Templates that's why we decided to organize them into two visually separate categories.
