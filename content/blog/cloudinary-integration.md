## Image Transformation and Responsive Image Delivery

Today we're proud to announce an easy way to optimize your image delivery with a Cloudinary integration for Forestry.

As a developer you can now use the super fast Cloudinary CDN and store your assets outside your repository. While at the same time your editors can use Forestry's Media Library and Editor to upload and manage Cloudinary assets without even knowing it.

{{% tip %}}

It's as simple as adding your cloud name, API key and secret to your site's settings to get started. You can set up Cloudinary + Forestry in less than 3 Minutes: [Create a Cloudinary Account](https://cloudinary.com/) and follow along with our [docs](https://forestry.io/docs/media/cloudinary/).

This integration makes it possible to efficiently store, organize and deliver images in Cloudinary while keeping the editing experience simple and clean in Forestry.

Non-developers can continue to use our simple drag and drop feature without having to juggle assets across different accounts and multiple providers.

The Forestry Media Library and Cloudinary are always in sync. All assets on Cloudinary can be accessed through the Forestry Media Library and vice versa.

Instead of only supporting a subset of Cloudinaryâ€™s features in our UI, Forestry gives you the maximum amount of flexibility for upload resources. Once you connect Cloudinary to your account, Forestry only inserts the `image_name.extension` without any path components into your Front Matter, allowing you to use Cloudinary's URL-based manipulations. 

Here are a few examples of image manipulation via Cloudinary URLs: <p data-height="400" data-theme-id="light" data-slug-hash="YvzVXX" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="germoe" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="YvzVXX" class="codepen" html-proofer-ignore>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/germoe/pen/YvzVXX/">Cloudinary Example</a> on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p><script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script><p>

# Other New Features

We also rolled out a few other features that might be interesting to you.

## Front Matter Templates for Data Files

This update allows you to [use and change templates for data files](https://forestry.io/docs/editing/data-files/#customizing-fields).

![](/uploads/2018/05/template-for-data-files.png)

Until now you weren't able to use templates with data files and anytime the format of the data files changed a developer needed to go into the code base.

## Color Picker

This [new field](https://forestry.io/docs/settings/fields/color-picker/) allows your users to easily change colors in a Front Matter Field from within Forestry.

You can add values through HEX, RGB or pick a color from the selector.

## OAuth Login for Remote Admin

OAuth login is now available in the remote admin.

You can now login with your favorite Git-provider.
