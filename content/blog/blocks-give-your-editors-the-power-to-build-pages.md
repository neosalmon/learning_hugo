Today we introduce _Blocks_ - a powerful Field Type that enables your editors to build entire landing pages from scratch and create rich blog post layouts with a pre-defined code template, we call it a _Block Template_.

This feature was inspired by CraftCMS' [Matrix fields](https://craftcms.com/features/matrix) and the Wordpress Plugin [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/).

## What is Blocks?

Blocks is a Field Type that is made up of multiple templates, so-called _Block Templates_. These templates are repeatable layouts that can be used without having to touch any code.

Using Blocks, Editors can compose and reorganize entire pages without the support of a developer.

Blocks makes it possible for Editors to create pages like our homepage within minutes.

{{% tip %}}We created [Sawmill](https://github.com/dwalkr/sawmill) as a Starter-Kit and an [Introduction to Blocks](/blog/sawmill-layout-composer-for-hugo-and-forestry/) so you can get started right away.{{% /tip %}}

## How do Blocks work?

The developer creates the _Block Templates_ as clean code chunks and groups the templates that make up a Blocks Field for a certain type of content. The editor can then bootstrap entire pages composing and rearranging these pre-defined blocks without affecting the _Block Templates_ itself.

## Need to know more?

We just published a Frontend Friday [article](/blog/sawmill-layout-composer-for-hugo-and-forestry/) providing an in-depth explanation on how to use blocks and set them up.
