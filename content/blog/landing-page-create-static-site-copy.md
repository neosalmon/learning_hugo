## Modern Asset Pipeline

Add modern web development tools to your website with CLI.

### Cross-browser and legacy browser support

JavaScript and CSS are optimized using Babel and CSSNext to make sure your site works as expected across browsers and versions.

### Live-Reloading via BrowserSync

Automatically reload the browser window when changes are detected.

### Use JavaScript Tools

Organize your code in modules, use the latest JavaScript language features and minify for the best performance.

### Optimize Images

Images are automatically optimized and SVG are combined into a single spritesheet.

## Hassle-free Updates

There is no need to maintain the configuration yourself, everything can be handled with a single-dependency.

**Need a more custom solution?** Use Create-Static-Site to get a jump start on your configuration and just eject the project when you make your changes.
_Please note that from that point on you’ll have to maintain the build configuration yourself._
