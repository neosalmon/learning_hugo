It is an understatement to say we weren’t the biggest fans of WordPress. Static sites are at the core of Forestry.io’s business model. They provide a more secure, flexible and performant environment than WordPress.

Yet, I’m excited to announce that today we’re moving our Forestry.io website to WordPress. Visit our new site [here](/wordpress.html). 

Forestry.io CMS has done its absolute best to create a seamless, customized UI to any static site. However, our site has some very specific needs that our own CMS can’t fulfill. Let me explain why this move is the right one for us:

WordPress offers all options right on the Dashboard. The user can add widgets and plugins, change the appearance, check the SEO and much more. WordPress can do all that and not even feel crowded.

There’s almost 55,000 plugins. No other platform provides as vast a portfolio of plugins as WordPress does. The ability to quickly add and remove a plugin that implements state-of-the-art technologies is important. And there’s always a fallback plugin if one should fail ([Alternatives to 66 Dead WP Plugins](https://www.whoishostingthis.com/compare/wordpress/dead-plugins/)).

Maintenance and security issues with WordPress are well-known but the team at WordPress is working constantly on [crushing bugs and fixing vulnerabilities](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/latest).

At Forestry.io we love experimentation, whether it's on features, design or communication. Some of these experiments won’t ever see the light of day but our move to WordPress has just become reality. Join us for this wild rollercoaster ride!
