Are you getting the most out of your static site? If you’re not hosting your site on a CDN, you definitely aren’t.

CDNs, or **Content Delivery Networks**, are commonly used to distribute static resources like images, videos, and client-side code (CSS and JavaScript.) Since a static site is composed entirely of static resources (including the HTML pages,) it is possible to serve the entire website through a CDN!

In this article, we will explore why you should be using a CDN to host your static site, and how you can do it with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Netlify makes it so easy to deploy and host your static site with their CDN, you have no excuse not to do it!

## The Ping Problem

One metric that is used when evaluating the performance of a web page is the **time to first byte**, or **TTFB**. This measures how long it takes for the client to _begin_ receiving data from the server.

There are two main problems that increase TTFB:

1. We have to wait for data to travel across the physical wires that make up the internet.
2. We have to wait for the server to process the request after receiving it, and prepare the response before sending it.

For a dynamic site like WordPress, problem #2 is a frequent bottleneck. The server has a lot of WordPress code to run in order to prepare the response to be sent to the client. However, with static sites,  this is nearly instantaneous, since the pages are all generated when the site is deployed. Problem #2 is not really a problem for us!

So, is there anything we can do about problem #1?

The time it takes for data to travel across a network is referred to as **latency**. Latency is primarily a physical limitation: a signal needs to travel through a cable; the longer the cable, the longer it will take the signal to move through it. Theoretically, we could transmit this signal [at the speed of light](https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/08/data-the-speed-of-light-and-you/), but in reality data moves much slower than that.

### Testing Latency

You might have heard network latency referred to as **ping.** This name comes from the `ping` utility which can be used to measure it. You most likely have this utility on your computer.

You can use `ping` yourself to understand how latency works. Open up a terminal and type the following command:

    ping ec2.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

This command will send a request to a server in Amazon’s `us-east-1` region, and wait for a response. The `us-east-1` region is located in Northern Virginia in the United States. When I run this command from my office in Maryland, I get the following response:

    PING ec2.us-east-1.amazonaws.com (54.239.28.176) 56(84) bytes of data. 
    64 bytes from 54.239.28.176: icmp_seq=1 ttl=232 time=50.3 ms

The `ping` utility reported that it took 50.3 milliseconds for data to travel from my computer to Amazon’s server and back.

By changing the hostname in my command from `ec2.us-east-1.amazonaws.com` to `ec2.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com`, I can ping their Sydney, Australia region instead:

    PING ec2.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com (54.240.195.243) 56(84) bytes of data. 
    64 bytes from 54.240.195.243: icmp_seq=1 ttl=233 time=301 ms

Communicating with the more distant server caused a _500% increase_ in round-trip latency. 250 milliseconds may sound like a short amount of time, but this time penalty applies to _every request_ the user makes to that server: CSS, JavaScript, images, etc. Even [small amounts of latency can negatively impact your site](https://blog.gigaspaces.com/amazon-found-every-100ms-of-latency-cost-them-1-in-sales/). If there were an easy way to eliminate this latency, wouldn’t you want to do it?

{{% tip %}}
If you want to experiment with pinging other regions, take a look at this [chart of EC2 regions](http://ec2-reachability.amazonaws.com/). You can ping the IP address directly, or use a hostname following the convention `ec2.$REGION.amazonaws.com`.

## Improving Latency With a CDN

There are plenty of technologies that rely on real-time peer-to-peer communication. A static site is not one of them! One way we can solve this latency problem is by replicating our website to multiple servers distributed across the globe. Imagine that I could deploy two copies of my site to AWS: one copy to the `us-east-1` region, and another to the `ap-southeast-2` region, and somehow direct my users to whichever server was closer to them.

This is exactly what a CDN can do for us! CDN stands for **Content Delivery Network**, and its purpose is to replicate resources to a network of **edge nodes** distributed all over the world. When a user requests a resource hosted by the CDN, they are routed to the edge node closest to them.

To demonstrate this, I enlisted the help of my friend Chris (IG: [@chrismaustphotos](https://www.instagram.com/chrismaustphotos/)) who lives on the other side of the USA in San Diego, California. For this experiment, I had us both run the `ping` command against two hosts. The first host was the same `ec2.us-east-1.amazonaws.com` from the previous example, and the second was `forestry.io`. Forestry is hosted on AWS’ CloudFront CDN, so I was expecting it to take him longer to reach the `us-east-1` server, but for us both to reach `forestry.io` quickly. The results confirm this hypothesis:

### Ping Response Times

|  | DJ (Maryland) | Chris (California) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ec2.us-east-1.amazonaws.com | 50 ms | 80 ms |
| forestry.io | 33 ms | 15 ms |

Now, there several factors that affect ping, but here’s the takeaway: we both received a response from `forestry.io` faster than we received a response from the server in Northern Virginia, despite being on opposite ends of the country.

We can better understand what’s going on here by checking the [PTR record](https://www.cloudns.net/wiki/article/40/) for `forestry.io`'s IP address. To do this, run the following command:

    dig -x $IPADDRESS

Where `$IPADDRESS` is the resolved IP that was reported by the `ping` command. Your output will look something like this:

    dig -x 216.137.41.157 
    
    ; <<>> DiG 9.10.3-P4-Ubuntu <<>> -x 216.137.41.157 
    ;; global options: +cmd 
    ;; Got answer: 
    ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 25470 
    ;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1

    ;; QUESTION SECTION:

    ;; WHEN: Thu Jun 07 12:50:18 EDT 2018 
    ;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 113

Make note of the PTR record in the answer section. This IP points to `server-216-137-41-157.ewr2.r.cloudfront.net`. This is one of CloudFront’s edge nodes, and the `ewr2` is a hint that this node is located in Newark, New Jersey (AWS is using a naming convention based on airport codes, and EWR is the code for Newark Liberty International Airport.)

When Chris ran his `ping` command, `forestry.io` resolved to a different IP address. Running the same command on this IP address, we see `server-52-85-83-253.lax1.r.cloudfront.net`. Once again we can follow AWS’ naming convention to deduce that the `lax` subdomain means that this node is located in Los Angeles.

### TL;DR

Using a CDN allows us to host copies of our website all over the world. When a user requests our site, the CDN directs them to the nearest copy to minimize latency.
