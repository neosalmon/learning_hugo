          <h1>Passive Aggressive Password Machine</h1>
          <p><em>Imagine your in-laws are helping you with a password… this is what they’d say.</em></p>

<p>I always irk a little inside, when a machine tells me something that I’ve done is wrong. The most common form of that, is probably passwords. “Your password is too weak”, “Your password needs to contain a number and a special character”.</p>

<p>While I absolutely understand why they need to be this way (they’re looking out for us!) … that said, its the jarring interaction that I wanted to focus on. What if they said meaner and meaner things. Thats what this website is all about.</p>

<p>This was done in collab with a new friend of mine, <a href="http://www.vanschneider.com/">Tobias</a>, who worked with me on the designs and interactions.</p>
