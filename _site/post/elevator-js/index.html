          <h1>Elevator JS</h1>
          <p><em>Elevator music for when you press those “back to top” buttons.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://tholman.com/elevator.js/">Elevator.js</a> strung out from a small hack-day experiment, while I was working at tumblr.</p>

<p>The library is fairly simple, but again was a fun learning experience. When you hit the “back to top” button, it plays music, as though it were an elevator scrolling to the top.</p>

<p>Technology wise, its all vanilla JavaScript, and a single MP4 audio file. The trickiest part of this was getting the scroll to act smoothly, for this we needed to incorporate some easing algorithms.</p>

<p>Naturally, I built a small web page to show it off as well… although you should probably visit the <a href="http://tholman.com/elevator.js/">site</a> to actually see it in action.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/elevator-js-1.png" alt="Elevator.js Website" /></p>

<p>The library was built to be able to take in any music file, so its pretty malliable. In the time the library has been out, I’ve spotted it on a lot of websites, including one for Google IO.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Woah, this got super popular. Now is my most popular open source project.</p>
