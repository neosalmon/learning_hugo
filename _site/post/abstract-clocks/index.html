          <h1>Abstract Clocks</h1>
          <p><em>I recently talked to Electric Object about building something on their platform for their <a href="https://www.electricobjects.com/artists">artists program</a>, this is what I came up with.</em></p>

<p>When I was looking into what I could do on the Electric Object, the biggest thing that stood out to me was that not many people were taking advantage of the fact that it can run a browser, and as such, can display something made programmatically on the fly, or change with time. Instantly I wanted to do something with time.</p>

<p>Over the years, I’ve amassed a large collection of <a href="https://codepen.io/collection/moAia/">clocks and timers</a> on CodePen, which served as a big inspirational source. The general idea here, is that the clocks would be abstract and difficult to read, but after spending a week with them it would be as easy to read as a regular clock, in a sense, the same way people are able to read time from the sun.</p>

<p>The theme for the clocks came as a combination of the original circular clock face, but instead using gradients as clock hands. From here, a lot of experimentation and explorations occured, resulting in the 5 “types” of clock.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/abstract-clocks-1.png" alt="A few of the clocks." /></p>

<p>You can read about how to understand each clock, on this little <a href="http://tholman.com/abstract-clocks/">web page</a> … some of them are a little trickier to get a handle on than the others, but ultimately learnable.</p>
