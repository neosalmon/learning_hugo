          <h1>Generative Artistry</h1>
          <p><em>Generative Artistry is a small venture I’m making into blogging actual code! Including something I’ve been thinking a lot about, self coding tutorials.</em></p>

<p>I’m super excited about <a href="http://generativeartistry.com">Generative Artistry</a>, its going to be a great avenue for me to explore technical blogging, as well as an experimentation into how people learn to code. There’s been a ton of encouraging feedback, that is leading to my next release, which will be called Tutorial Markdown, a markdown style for interactive blogging.</p>

<p>The site itself is a simple blog, built on <a href="https://gohugo.io/">hugo</a>, a static site build built with GO… its primary focus is speed.</p>

<p>The site provides a list of tutorials, simple as that.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/generative-artistry-2.png" alt="Another Generative Artistry Site Pic" /></p>

<p>The tutorials are where the magic really happens, as you scroll through the posts, the code is compiled together in a small editor (to the top left), and then executes in an iframe at the bottom left.</p>

<p>This means that as you’re reading the post, you can scroll back and forth between code examples and see the difference and steps. This helps build a much stronger understanding about the code thats heading into the editor, and can hopefully help to foster a better learning process.</p>

<p>Tutorial Markdown is still in the works, but I’ll be sure to update this post when its ready!</p>
