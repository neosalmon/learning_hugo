          <h1>The Zen Zone</h1>
          <p><em>The Zen Zone is an exploration into what it takes to slow myself down, switch off, meditate.</em></p>

<p>The idea behind the Zen Zone has been sitting in my head for a year or so now… the thought that I sometimes get stuck focusing on a simple boring task, but when I’m supposed to be focusing on something, like work for example, I find myself wandering aimlessly.</p>

<p>After using Vue recently for the <a href="/post/what-have-you-made-today/">What Have You Made Today</a> extension, I decided to rock back to React for this one. Honestly I feel that both of them are very similar when it comes down to designing and ideating while you create… so no harm dancing around a little bit.</p>

<p>I set out to build a few simple “games” that would keep me captivated, and went in search of inspiration outside of the regular web circles.</p>

<p>The Switches game is inspired by… well, every day switching on the lights. As well as that little satisfaction you can get when animating things nicely in code.</p>

<p>The Swirl game has been inspired by the Japanese zen gardens, of which monks would focus on to help clear the mind.</p>

<p>The Break game was inspired by the general nature and make-up of all things. Everything can be broken down into smaller and smaller pieces.</p>

<p>The games are stitched together in a way that makes me feel like I can expand upon these games easily, add more to the platform, and grow it out when I feel.</p>

<p>Having launched the project, there is a lot to be done straight off the cuff design and development wise. So lots do do still!</p>
