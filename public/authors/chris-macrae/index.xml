      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve also compared Jekyll &amp;amp; Hugo features across 6 dimensions. Learn More
 Hugo and Jekyll are the leading static site generators according to StaticGen.com, and both supported by our CMS. We&amp;rsquo;re often asked which tool performs better so we decided to do an analysis.
TL;DR We ran two tests to measure build times with Hugo and Jekyll. The basic test used the default installation of Jekyll and Hugo to build sites with 10 posts,100 posts, 1,000 posts and 10,000 posts.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve got great improvements to share with you from¬†Forestry.io, involving Forestry‚Äôs Media Library.
The Media Library allows content editors to easily upload images, videos, and much more without needing to understand Git.
Single Upload Directory We&amp;rsquo;ve received a lot of feedback from the community about which media should be displayed in the media library.
Forestry used to display media from all folders throughout the project. Not all of these folders are useful for your editors, and resulted in theme assets, favicons, and other media being displayed.</description>

      <description>Introducing Forestry Config Files Last month we released a big update to Front Matter Templates, which provided an unprecedented level of control over the user interface content editors use to edit their Hugo and Jekyll sites with.
Today we‚Äôre introducing a new feature to equally empower developers: Forestry Config Files.
Config files allow developers to create and manage the settings and Front Matter Templates of a site directly in the Git Repo.</description>

      <description>This week we‚Äôve got a small, but very useful update we&amp;rsquo;re excited to share with you.

Give Us Feedback While the WYSIWYG features are inline only right now, we‚Äôre looking to develop this field into a truly powerful tool.</description>

      <description>For Hugo users a few great updates came out recently with a long-awaited feature:¬†nested sections. Along with nested sections, Hugo 0.22-0.24 added a series of improvements that make building websites even easier.
Nested Sections, What‚Äôs The Big Deal? If you‚Äôre not familiar with Hugo, sections are the different types of content your Hugo site has. For example Posts, Pages, and Press Releases.
Until Hugo 0.22, nesting sections weren‚Äôt supported as a feature, meaning you couldn‚Äôt easily have a hierarchical relationship between different types of content.</description>

      <description>Document Locking &amp;amp; Collaboration To prevent accidental overwrites and the tango of content editing, we‚Äôve added in a locking feature to your content and data files. If you attempt to edit a page another user is editing, you‚Äôll get a notification.
We‚Äôve also made collaboration more powerful by making drafts shared. If you make changes to a document without publishing, the rest of your team will see these changes when they view the page.</description>
