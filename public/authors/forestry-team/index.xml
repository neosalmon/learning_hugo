      <title>Could not locate Gemfile or .bundle/ directory</title>

      <description>When I view an error log from Forestry I see: Could not locate Gemfile or .bundle/ directory What this error means Gemfiles include a list of project dependencies and where to find them. Bundler is a dependency manager for the Ruby programming language that can read Gemfiles, resolve the dependency graph and install those gems. Jekyll is a ruby application and can use Bundler to manage your project dependencies. Forestry requires that your Jekyll projects contain a Gemfile at the root of the repository.</description>
