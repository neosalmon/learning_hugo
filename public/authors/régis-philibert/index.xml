      <description>Hugo makes it super easy to build simple APIs with its built-in output formats. In my previous article, we built a fully functional JSON API. Today we’re going to extend the capabilities of this API and improve the user experience with better URLs.
At the moment our API can look up specific items, but can’t look at them in relation to each other. Say you want to know what players are in a specific team: with our current API, you can&amp;rsquo;t do that easily.</description>

      <description>As developers, we love open and accessible data. For example, you may want to use your local transit data for a mobile app, or maybe you want a service like Zapier or IFTTT to send you an email every time the weather forecast calls for rain. If you’re a super geek like @bdougieyo, you’ve built an app that tells you when to leave work in order to avoid traffic from your local baseball team’s home games (from his excellent talk here).</description>
