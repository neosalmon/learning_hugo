IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS OF USE, THEN DO NOT USE THE FORESTRY.IO APP OR THIS WEBSITE OR ANY OF ITS CONTENT OR SERVICES.

<p>IF YOU REGISTER FOR AN ACCOUNT YOU WILL BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE CERTAIN PERSONAL INFORMATION. ALL PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT YOU PROVIDE TO US WILL BE TREATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR PRIVACY POLICY, THE TERMS OF WHICH FORM AN INTEGRAL PART OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF OUR PRIVACY POLICY, DO NOT USE THIS WEBSITE OR THE SERVICES.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>The Service.</strong> The Forestry.io provides a website hosting, website management and website publishing subscription service targeted towards developers and programmers (the <strong>&ldquo;Service&rdquo;</strong>). We offer a tiered pricing model depending on how many websites you are managing and how many users you need to access the account, as is more fully described in the Subscription Accounts section below.</li>
<li><strong>Registration.</strong> You must be at least eighteen (18) years old to register for an account. If you are registering for a paid subscription account, you must also have a valid credit card. When you register, you will be required to provide your first and last name, an email address and create a password. All personal information that you provide to us will be treated in accordance with the terms of our privacy policy, which you should read carefully. You are responsible for all activity occurring on your account, so please choose a strong password and do not share it with any other person. Please notify us immediately if you become aware or suspect that your account has been compromised.</li>
<li><strong>Subscription Accounts.</strong> Once you have registered for an account, you will be prompted to choose the type of account you want, i.e. free or paid. We offer a range of account options including a free account for unlimited websites and one user, an account that provides hosting services for unlimited websites, and account access for five users, to an unlimited account that provides hosting for unlimited websites and account access to unlimited users. The pricing for our various subscriptions is found on the pricing page of our website. If you choose an account that provides hosting services for multiple websites, and access for multiple users, you will be required to select and account administrator (<strong>&ldquo;Administrator&rdquo;</strong>). Administrators are responsible for granting other users access to the account, and can do so by inputting the name and email address of the individual and sending an invitation to use the Service. For greater you may only have one account per person. If we discover that you have registered for multiple free accounts, we reserve the right to terminate your access to the services immediately and without notice.</li>
<li><strong>Using the Services.</strong> Once you have registered for an Account and chosen your subscription plan, you will be able to import your project into the Website, either by dragging a zip file, or importing from another service such as GitHub. Once you have uploaded your website and files to your account, you will be able to manage your website via the Services.</li>
<li><strong>Content.</strong> All information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, files, videos, messages or other materials, whether publicly posted or privately transmitted to the Website by Users (<strong>&ldquo;User Content&rdquo;</strong>), is the sole responsibility of such Users. This means that Users, and not Forestry.io, are entirely responsible for all such material uploaded, posted, emailed, transmitted or otherwise made available by using the Service. Forestry.io does not control or actively monitor User Content and, as such, does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of such content. Under no circumstances will Forestry.io be liable in any way for any materials, including, but not limited to, materials that infringe third party rights, for any errors or omissions in any materials or any defects or errors in any printing or manufacturing, or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the viewing or use of any materials posted, emailed, transmitted or otherwise made available via the Service.</li>
<li><strong>Restrictions on User Content and Use of the Service.</strong> Forestry.io reserves the right at all times (but will have no obligation) to remove or refuse to distribute any User Content and to terminate users or reclaim usernames or suspend or restrict account access for violations of these Terms of Use. We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce these Terms of Use, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect the rights, property or safety of our users and the public.</li>

<li>copy any content unless expressly permitted to do so herein;</li>
<li>impersonate any person or entity or misrepresent their affiliation with a person or entity;</li>
<li>interfere with or disrupt the Website or servers or networks connected to the Website, or disobey any requirements, procedures, policies or regulations of networks connected to the Website or probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any system or network or breach or circumvent any security or authentication measures;</li>

Non-payment of fees will result in the suspension or termination of your account. It is not the policy of Forestry.io to provide refunds, and accordingly if you terminate your account part way through any Term, you will not be entitled to a refund of any pre-paid fees.</li>

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Forestry.io grants you a non-transferable, non-exclusive, license to (a) use the Website for your internal business purposes (the <strong>&ldquo;License&rdquo;</strong>). Nothing in the Terms gives you a right to use the Forestry.io or Forestry.io names, trademarks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features without our prior written consent. Any future release, update, or other addition to functionality of the Website shall be subject to the terms of these Terms.</li>

<li><strong>Term.</strong> This agreement is effective as of the day that it is entered into by you, and continues for a period of one (1) calendar month (the <strong>&ldquo;Initial Term&rdquo;</strong>), and thereafter shall continue to automatically renew for successive one (1) month periods (<strong>&ldquo;Renewal Term&rdquo;</strong>) until terminated in accordance with the terms of this agreement (collectively, the Initial Term and the Renewal Term shall be the <strong>&ldquo;Term&rdquo;</strong>).</li>
<li><strong>Termination.</strong> You may terminate your account for any reason at any time; however we ask that you provide us with at least five (5) business days&rsquo; notice before the start of the next Term if you do not wish to be charged for an additional Term. Additionally, Forestry.io may, under certain circumstances and without prior notice, immediately terminate Your ability to access the Website or portions thereof. Cause for such termination shall include, but not be limited to, (a) breaches or violations of these Terms of Use or any other agreement that You may have with Forestry.io (including, without limitation, non-payment of any fees owed in connection with the website or otherwise owed by You to Forestry.io), (b) requests by law enforcement or other government agencies, (d) discontinuance or material modification to the website (or any part thereof), (e) unexpected technical, security or legal issues or problems, and/or (f) participation by You, directly or indirectly, in fraudulent or illegal activities. Termination of Your access to the Website may also include removal of some or all of the materials uploaded by You to the Website. You acknowledge and agree that all terminations may be made by Forestry.io in its sole discretion and that Forestry.io shall not be liable to You or any third-party for any termination of Your access to this Website or for the removal of any of the materials uploaded by You to the Website. Any termination of these terms of use by Forestry.io shall be in addition to any and all other rights and remedies that Forestry.io may have.</li>
