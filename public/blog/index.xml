      <title>uBuild: A New Jekyll Theme Using Blocks</title>
      <link>https://forestry.io/blog/ubuild-a-new-theme-for-static-sites-using-blocks/</link>

      <description>Back in April we announced a feature that we believed was a game-changer for static site content managers. Blocks was here to introduce a way for you to put together sites using pre-composed site snippets inside Forestry.
While we did our best to show you how to set them up and give you an idea of how powerful they could be, we noticed that getting to know Blocks and figuring out how to set them up from scratch wasn&amp;rsquo;t as self-explanatory as we had hoped.</description>

      <description>We just made a big change to how we handle Hugo projects and introduced a few new features that make it easier to stay organized.
Hugo Support for All Versions üî•üî•üî• Hugo has a great developer community that is constantly pushing new versions out. Until now you sometimes had to wait a few months until you were able to use the latest version of Hugo with Forestry as we were trying to catch up.</description>

      <title>5 Ways to Handle Forms on Your Static Site</title>

      <description>When I first started exploring the potential of static sites, I was attracted by their speed and simplicity. I knew these benefits came at a cost, however: since static sites can‚Äôt run backend code, there are limits to what you can accomplish with a static solution.
I no longer see things this way.
JAMStack is not about sacrificing features for the sake of a performant, easy to maintain website. Rather, it is about re-evaluating how much of your desired functionality should be delegated to your web frontend.</description>

      <description>It‚Äôs a cloudy day ‚òÅÔ∏è here on Prince Edward Island, the perfect opportunity to announce some new features.
Over the past couple weeks, we were hard at work to improve the editor experience for our Git-backed content manager. Renaming files is just one of those updates. We also needed to improve notifications and indicators to make working in a team on Forestry easier.
Renaming Files ‚úçÔ∏è Freshly out ‚Äî you can now change the name for your content files with Forestry.</description>

      <title>For Static Sites, There‚Äôs No Excuse Not to Use a CDN</title>

      <description>Are you getting the most out of your static site? If you‚Äôre not hosting your site on a CDN, you definitely aren‚Äôt.
CDNs, or Content Delivery Networks, are commonly used to distribute static resources like images, videos, and client-side code (CSS and JavaScript.) Since a static site is composed entirely of static resources (including the HTML pages,) it is possible to serve the entire website through a CDN!
In this article, we will explore why you should be using a CDN to host your static site, and how you can do it with Netlify.</description>

      <title>Mastering Image Delivery With Cloudinary</title>
      <link>https://forestry.io/blog/master-image-delivery-with-cloudinary/</link>

      <guid>https://forestry.io/blog/master-image-delivery-with-cloudinary/</guid>
      <description>Applying a responsive strategy for displaying images means more than just adding max-width: 100%; to your image tags. You don&amp;rsquo;t want to display an image that is much larger than the area it occupies, otherwise you‚Äôre just wasting bits. You need to deliver scaled-down versions of these images where appropriate.
A popular way to generate these scaled-down assets is to automatically resize our images during the build process, using something like a gulp task, but that solution isn&amp;rsquo;t perfect.</description>

      <description>Image Transformation and Responsive Image Delivery Today we&amp;rsquo;re proud to announce an easy way to optimize your image delivery with a Cloudinary integration for Forestry.
As a developer you can now use the super fast Cloudinary CDN and store your assets outside your repository. While at the same time your editors can use Forestry&amp;rsquo;s Media Library and Editor to upload and manage Cloudinary assets without even knowing it.
It&amp;rsquo;s as simple as adding your cloud name, API key and secret to your site&amp;rsquo;s settings to get started.</description>

      <description>Hugo makes it super easy to build simple APIs with its built-in output formats. In my previous article, we built a fully functional JSON API. Today we‚Äôre going to extend the capabilities of this API and improve the user experience with better URLs.
At the moment our API can look up specific items, but can‚Äôt look at them in relation to each other. Say you want to know what players are in a specific team: with our current API, you can&amp;rsquo;t do that easily.</description>

      <title>How To Use Hugo&#39;s Image Processing With Forestry</title>

      <guid>https://forestry.io/blog/how-to-use-hugo-s-image-processing-with-forestry/</guid>
      <description>0.32 update introduced built-in image processing for certain assets. One limitation of this feature is that it only works for page resources, which are page-relative assets stored alongside your posts in the content/ directory of your site. Since Forestry‚Äôs uploads are stored in the static/uploads/ directory by default, these assets cannot be resized in your templates using Hugo‚Äôs built-in resizer. This document will provide a step-by-step guide for working around this limitation.</description>

      <description>Picture this: it&amp;rsquo;s 2018, and your client needs an online store. You know that static sites are great: they&amp;rsquo;re easy to scale, have a minimal attack surface, and are very fast. However, since a static site can&amp;rsquo;t run backend code, it won&amp;rsquo;t be able to do some things necessary for e-commerce, such as process customer orders. Can you really use a static site to operate an e-commerce storefront?
Of course you can!</description>

      <title>What&#39;s New in Jekyll 3.8</title>

      <guid>https://forestry.io/blog/what-s-new-in-jekyll-3.8/</guid>
      <description>What‚Äôs new in Jekyll 3.8 Jekyll 3.8.1 was released on the 1st of May 2018, just two weeks after 3.8.0. The project has come a long way since I last wrote a Jekyll update on Forestry. Olivia is now Jekyll‚Äôs new Lead Developer since Parker Moore decided to step down after four years leading the project.
So what does Jekyll bring us this time?
Performance optimizations Large sites containing a huge amount of posts are going to see a massive reduction in their total build times especially if they are doing multiple calls to the where filter with the same input and property parameter.</description>

      <description>Part of our mission at Forestry is to dissolve the perceived limitations of static sites. In reality, static sites are easy to understand and integrate with, and the belief that static sites are not capable of feature X is largely a failure of imagination. With a little cleverness and determination, virtually anything is possible on a static platform.
Previously, we showed you how to set up Algolia with Jekyll as well as with Hugo to make your content searchable.</description>

      <description>Create React App is a utility provided by the Facebook team in support of the React JavaScript framework. The goal of Create React App is to allow developers to quickly bootstrap a React project without having to spend time sorting out the build pipeline. With over 47,000 stars on Github (over half as many as the actual React library,) Create React App&amp;rsquo;s popularity speaks for itself.
The success and utility of Create React App has inspired the Forestry.</description>

      <description>When it comes to creating websites, good content strategy is all about turning ideas into HTML with a minimal amount of friction. Whether using a CMS with a web interface or editing content files for a static site generator, content creators need an easy way to create visually interesting and well-structured content.
Every approach is a compromise between flexibility and ease-of-use. Even if a developer could anticipate all of a content creator&amp;rsquo;s needs, these needs will change over time.</description>

      <description>Today we introduce Blocks - a powerful Field Type that enables your editors to build entire landing pages from scratch and create rich blog post layouts with a pre-defined code template, we call it a Block Template.
This feature was inspired by CraftCMS&amp;rsquo; Matrix fields and the Wordpress Plugin Advanced Custom Fields.
What is Blocks? Blocks is a Field Type that is made up of multiple templates, so-called Block Templates.</description>

      <guid>https://forestry.io/blog/discontinuing-wysiwyg-editor-new-focus-on-markdown/</guid>
      <description>We are not changing or removing the Markdown WYSIWYG editor. Our Markdown editor will continue to offer both plaintext and WYSIWYG input modes. In fact, removing the HTML WYSIWYG editor will allow us to focus on making the Markdown editor even better.
 The HTML WYSIWYG Editor has proven to be less and less the state-of-the-art content editing experience it once set out to be. Considering the issues the HTML WYSIWYG Editor causes and the merits Markdown provides we made the decision to discontinue our WYSIWYG HTML Editor on 5/11/2018.</description>

      <description>Choosing the right tools to build a website isn‚Äôt easy these days. There‚Äôs just too many options! Building a static site is one of these options, which comes with many advantages like top-notch security, blazingly-fast performance, and reduced costs.
When it comes to building static sites, the two leading solutions right now are Hugo and Jekyll. So the question is, which is right for you?
To answer that question, we‚Äôll take a look at the features, speed, and extensibility of each, looking for the pros and the cons of both generators.</description>

      <description>I get it. The JavaScript ecosystem is exhausting. There exists an abundance of tools and frameworks, and each one wants to rescue you from the shortcomings of its peers. Attempting to learn and keep up with these tools takes time and energy that you would rather devote to your project. Reducing cognitive overhead is a core component of Forestry.io&amp;rsquo;s philosophy ‚Äî we designed a static site CMS that is easy to set up and use.</description>

 Hugo and Jekyll are the leading static site generators according to StaticGen.com, and both supported by our CMS. We&amp;rsquo;re often asked which tool performs better so we decided to do an analysis.
TL;DR We ran two tests to measure build times with Hugo and Jekyll. The basic test used the default installation of Jekyll and Hugo to build sites with 10 posts,100 posts, 1,000 posts and 10,000 posts.</description>

The Media Library allows content editors to easily upload images, videos, and much more without needing to understand Git.

Forestry used to display media from all folders throughout the project. Not all of these folders are useful for your editors, and resulted in theme assets, favicons, and other media being displayed.</description>

      <title>Discontinuing Zip-imported Sites</title>

      <description>Letting developers import a site from a zip archive is a feature that a lot of our users have made use of. However, with our strong focus on Git-backed workflows, we feel that that sites imported with zips have been providing a unsatisfactory experience.
At Forestry, we believe Git-backed content management systems are the future of content management, and that using a Git repository is the best way to manage sites.</description>

      <description>Introducing Forestry Config Files Last month we released a big update to Front Matter Templates, which provided an unprecedented level of control over the user interface content editors use to edit their Hugo and Jekyll sites with.
Today we‚Äôre introducing a new feature to equally empower developers: Forestry Config Files.
Config files allow developers to create and manage the settings and Front Matter Templates of a site directly in the Git Repo.</description>

      <description>This week we‚Äôve got a small, but very useful update we&amp;rsquo;re excited to share with you.
WYSIWYG Formatting in Textareas Our textarea Front Matter field has been upgraded to allow for WYSIWYG input. Enjoy being able to add bold, italic, underline, and code formatting.
Enable WYSIWYG for Textareas You can enable the WYSIWYG features by enabling the ‚ÄúWYSIWYG‚Äù toggle on any textarea Front Matter field.
Give Us Feedback While the WYSIWYG features are inline only right now, we‚Äôre looking to develop this field into a truly powerful tool.</description>

      <guid>https://forestry.io/blog/a-hugo-update-everyone-should-be-talking-about/</guid>
      <description>For Hugo users a few great updates came out recently with a long-awaited feature:¬†nested sections. Along with nested sections, Hugo 0.22-0.24 added a series of improvements that make building websites even easier.
Nested Sections, What‚Äôs The Big Deal? If you‚Äôre not familiar with Hugo, sections are the different types of content your Hugo site has. For example Posts, Pages, and Press Releases.
Until Hugo 0.22, nesting sections weren‚Äôt supported as a feature, meaning you couldn‚Äôt easily have a hierarchical relationship between different types of content.</description>

      <description>Document Locking &amp;amp; Collaboration To prevent accidental overwrites and the tango of content editing, we‚Äôve added in a locking feature to your content and data files. If you attempt to edit a page another user is editing, you‚Äôll get a notification.
We‚Äôve also made collaboration more powerful by making drafts shared. If you make changes to a document without publishing, the rest of your team will see these changes when they view the page.</description>

      <description>We all love working with Markdown but one of it&amp;rsquo;s biggest limitations is adding images to your content. That&amp;rsquo;s why we&amp;rsquo;re happy to announce the Forestry.io Media Manager. Nolan and Nichlas¬†put a lot of work into crafting an amazing UX for this, so we hope you like it. --
Media Manager Drag multiple files Handy if you have large image galleries.

      <description>As some of you may have noticed, Forestry was down for about 2.5 hours between 23:00 UTC March 27 until 01:30 UTC March 28. In the spirit of full disclosure I&amp;rsquo;d like to explain what happened and why.
Forestry is a Rails application and from time to time the number of migrations we have get unwieldy. Being an application under rapid development, things are constantly changing and migrations are created sometimes daily.</description>

      <description>Jekyll 3.4.0 was release on the 27th of January 2017 with some noteworthy enhancements that I&amp;rsquo;d like to share with you.
So what&amp;rsquo;s new?
Add connector param to ‚Äòarray_to_sentence_string‚Äô filter  array - The list of strings to join. string - A string can be any text inside quotes. In this example I will use Jekyll tags. connector - The word placed before the last word in the array. The default connector Jekyll uses is the word ‚Äúand‚Äù.</description>

      <description>Does the following sound familiar?¬†You set up a WP site, hand it off to a non-dev, and then they point to some unused part of the UI and say:
 &#34;What does this do?&#34;
 To which you sheepishly reply:
 &#34;Oh, that doesn&#39;t do anything...just ignore it.&#34;
 A CMS often feels like a work-around, designed for some other purpose.
Front Matter Templates (FMTs) FMTs allow you to customize the presentation of your UI fields in your CMS.</description>

      <description>Now you can add a Forestry.io CMS to your GitLab.com static site (Jekyll or Hugo).
I&amp;rsquo;ve been a GitLab user since their very first release in Oct of 2011. I worked at a design agency and converted everything over from SVN to Git and used an internal GitLab installation. I remember submitting a few bugs and Dmitriy was quick to fix them. We loved GitLab then, and still do today.</description>

      <description>When it comes to the Internet, content is king. A site that has well written content concisely tells the story behind a brand, helps to inform customers about a business&amp;rsquo; products or services and helps guide a user navigate to the information that they seek.
I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with various organizations in helping them choose the technology that is used to publish content onto their sites. When it came down to making a choice, the publishing platform options were often slimmed down by the need for non-technical users to easily publish content.</description>

      <description>My friend, Emily, needed a simple website for her restaurant. She&amp;rsquo;s a chef and didn&amp;rsquo;t want to deal with the hassle of DNS, hosting, design, etc. As a recovering freelancer, I offered to help.
Normally, I would use WordPress for a site like this, but I was fed up with the headaches that comes with maintaining a WordPress site. So, I took an evening and cranked out a simple 1-page static site.</description>
