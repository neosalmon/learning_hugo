      <description>Details Matter 002: My own blog -&amp;gt; I wrote an article on how Svbtle had some UI / UX flaws, and while browsing through my own blog I found some flaws glaring back at me as well. I plan on constantly updating this article, as you never know what part of my own blog I miss due to not paying enough attention to the details here.
Redundancy one- the nav.</description>

      <description>Details Matter 001: Svtble -&amp;gt; Before settling on a configuration utilizing Hugo and Netlify in order to serve this site up to you readers, I admittedly hopped around on my blog-wagon, jumping from one platform to the other- be it WordPress, Ghost, Jekyll, Grav, Postach.io or even the likes of Squarespace, Wix and Webflow.
During my &amp;ldquo;tours,&amp;rdquo; I stumbled across a rather eye-catching platform- (you guessed it) Svbtle. The reason I choose to write this first post dedicated to Svbtle&amp;rsquo;s inconsistencies in the UI / UX decisions is because had Svbtle accepted Debit Cards, you would&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at a Svbtle blog.</description>
