      <title>Storing Media Files</title>
      <link>https://forestry.io/docs/media/</link>

      <description>Forestry provides multiple options for media storage.
Git The most basic option for storing media is to commit it to your git repo like the rest of your content. This is the default setting for new projects.
If your site has a large number of media files, we highly recommend you select a different storage option. Very large git repos are slower to clone and work with and will not present an optimal development experience.</description>

      <description>Continuous Integration (CI) Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice where developers check-in code to a version control tool multiple times per day. Each time code is checked-in, an automated build is performed, allowing developers to identify problems with code quickly.
Continuous Delivery (CD) Continuous Delivery (CD) is a development practice where developers produce software in short cycles, ensuring that software can be easily released at any time. This ensures that developers are producing quality code and are identifying problems quickly.</description>

      <guid>https://forestry.io/docs/faqs/glossary/front-matter/</guid>
      <description>Front matter is structured metadata that is stored at the top of a content file, and is identified by delimiters before and after the metadata.
This metadata is available to your templates when generating your site, and allows you to build robust, dynamic features into your static site.
Depending your static site generator, Front Matter can be formatted as YAML, TOML, or JSON.
Examples YAML --- title: My New Post date: 2018-07-01 04:00:00 +0000 images: - /uploads/2018/07/01/twitter_card.</description>

      <title>How do I backup my site?</title>
      <link>https://forestry.io/docs/faqs/backups/</link>

      <guid>https://forestry.io/docs/faqs/backups/</guid>
      <description> For developers, backups are inherent due to the Git-backed nature of Forestry. Every change made to your site through Forestry is stored in version control.
However, a zip backup of your site can be downloaded from the dashboard if necessary.
Steps  Navigate to the dashboard Click the ... button beside the site you wish to download a backup of Choose &amp;ldquo;Download&amp;rdquo; from the menu  </description>

      <title>How do I set fallback/hidden values for Front Matter?</title>

      <guid>https://forestry.io/docs/faqs/front-matter-fallbacks/</guid>
      <description>Adding Front Matter to your content allows you to add variables and configuration to your pages that can be used in your templates.
Often times, you will find that you are repeating the same front matter values across many files. For example, setting the same layout, or adding the same author across many posts.
Or you may want to provide a default value for optional fields.
In this scenario, it&amp;rsquo;s possible to provide a fallback or hidden value.</description>

      <description> Static files are files that are not processed by your static site generator. Instead, they are just copied over as-is at built time.
Examples  Jekyll: in Jekyll, this is any file without front matter. Hugo: in Hugo, this is any file in the staticDir, which defaults to static/  </description>

      <guid>https://forestry.io/docs/faqs/glossary/static-site-generators/</guid>
      <description> Static Site Generators are developer tools that convert various data formats into static sites.
These data formats are generally content files stored in a Git repository. They can also be data pulled from third-party services.
Examples  Jekyll is the static site generator written in Ruby and created by GitHub founder, Tom Preston Werner. Hugo is the static site generator written in GoLang and created by Steve Francia.  </description>

      <guid>https://forestry.io/docs/faqs/glossary/static-sites/</guid>
      <description>Static sites are websites built using static, unchanging files. They require no server processing time to deliver the content to the user, which makes them very fast and performant.
Static site generators are the modern way of building static sites. They convert simple, text-based content files in static files ready for the web.
Theyâre fantastic for developers because they are extremely fast, are built to work with version-control, and require little-to-no setup compared to existing monolithic CMS solutions like Wordpress.</description>

      <description>Using Jekyll with GitHub Pages GitHub can handle building your Jekyll site without the need of Forestry or a CI tool. GitHub will build your Jekyll site each time a new commit is pushed to GitHub and serve it automatically.
Limitations When using GitHub to build your GitHub Pages site, you are restricted to using the white-listed GitHub Pages Jekyll version and plugins.
Getting Started This requires the GitHub pages gem.</description>

Backwards compatibility is always available for sites using an older version of Hugo that was supported when the site was added to Forestry.
Note: Forestry does not provide immediate support for Hugo releases.
Other Software We also support the following software that is supported by Hugo:

      <description>Forestry will use whatever version of Jekyll is specified in your Gemfile.
If you donât specify a version in your Gemfile, Forestry will use the default version used by GitHub Pages.
Defaults These are the ruby gems that Forestry will bundle with your build by default, without the need for a Gemfile. Forestry also lets you specify different versions of gems by including a Gemfile with your site.

      <title>Why did Forestry add files to my repo?</title>
      <link>https://forestry.io/docs/faqs/forestry-files/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2017 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forestry.io/docs/faqs/forestry-files/</guid>
      <description>Why did you add a .forestryio file? We add a file called .forestryio to the root of your project.
This file notifies Forestry that you have previously published to this location and that it is safe to publish to this location again.
Why did you add a .forestry folder? We add a folder called .forestry to the root of your project with the code configuration of your site.
This enables developers to edit the configuration of the CMS in their local environment, and keep changes to the configuration in version control.</description>

      <description>As devs, we hate when people mess with our code. So we try to do this as little as possible but sometimes it is unavoidable.
Front Matter Forestry will remove comments and other formatting from front matter, and will also reorder your fields alphabetically. This is unfortunately unavoidable, as comments and order are not respected in the YAML or TOML specifications.
Newlines New lines will be normalized so that all line endings are the same.</description>

      <description>Jekyll is one of the oldest static site generators available. Built by GitHub, it has tons of community support and is very stable. Additional features can be added onto Jekyll through the use of plugins. It also uses the templating language Liquid, which feels very familiar to developers and is also used by Shopify and other large-scale applications.
Choose Jekyll if you:  Want a static site generator with great stability and the biggest community.</description>

While we did our best to show you how to set them up and give you an idea of how powerful they could be, we noticed that getting to know Blocks and figuring out how to set them up from scratch wasn&amp;rsquo;t as self-explanatory as we had hoped.</description>

      <description>We just made a big change to how we handle Hugo projects and introduced a few new features that make it easier to stay organized.
Hugo Support for All Versions ð¥ð¥ð¥ Hugo has a great developer community that is constantly pushing new versions out. Until now you sometimes had to wait a few months until you were able to use the latest version of Hugo with Forestry as we were trying to catch up.</description>

      <title>5 Ways to Handle Forms on Your Static Site</title>

      <description>When I first started exploring the potential of static sites, I was attracted by their speed and simplicity. I knew these benefits came at a cost, however: since static sites canât run backend code, there are limits to what you can accomplish with a static solution.
I no longer see things this way.
JAMStack is not about sacrificing features for the sake of a performant, easy to maintain website. Rather, it is about re-evaluating how much of your desired functionality should be delegated to your web frontend.</description>

      <description>Itâs a cloudy day âï¸ here on Prince Edward Island, the perfect opportunity to announce some new features.
Over the past couple weeks, we were hard at work to improve the editor experience for our Git-backed content manager. Renaming files is just one of those updates. We also needed to improve notifications and indicators to make working in a team on Forestry easier.
Renaming Files âï¸ Freshly out â you can now change the name for your content files with Forestry.</description>

      <title>For Static Sites, Thereâs No Excuse Not to Use a CDN</title>
      <link>https://forestry.io/blog/for-static-sites-theres-no-excuse-not-to-use-a-cdn/</link>

      <description>Are you getting the most out of your static site? If youâre not hosting your site on a CDN, you definitely arenât.
CDNs, or Content Delivery Networks, are commonly used to distribute static resources like images, videos, and client-side code (CSS and JavaScript.) Since a static site is composed entirely of static resources (including the HTML pages,) it is possible to serve the entire website through a CDN!
In this article, we will explore why you should be using a CDN to host your static site, and how you can do it with Netlify.</description>

      <title>Mastering Image Delivery With Cloudinary</title>

      <description>Applying a responsive strategy for displaying images means more than just adding max-width: 100%; to your image tags. You don&amp;rsquo;t want to display an image that is much larger than the area it occupies, otherwise youâre just wasting bits. You need to deliver scaled-down versions of these images where appropriate.
A popular way to generate these scaled-down assets is to automatically resize our images during the build process, using something like a gulp task, but that solution isn&amp;rsquo;t perfect.</description>

      <description>Image Transformation and Responsive Image Delivery Today we&amp;rsquo;re proud to announce an easy way to optimize your image delivery with a Cloudinary integration for Forestry.
As a developer you can now use the super fast Cloudinary CDN and store your assets outside your repository. While at the same time your editors can use Forestry&amp;rsquo;s Media Library and Editor to upload and manage Cloudinary assets without even knowing it.
It&amp;rsquo;s as simple as adding your cloud name, API key and secret to your site&amp;rsquo;s settings to get started.</description>

      <description>Hugo makes it super easy to build simple APIs with its built-in output formats. In my previous article, we built a fully functional JSON API. Today weâre going to extend the capabilities of this API and improve the user experience with better URLs.
At the moment our API can look up specific items, but canât look at them in relation to each other. Say you want to know what players are in a specific team: with our current API, you can&amp;rsquo;t do that easily.</description>

      <title>How To Use Hugo&#39;s Image Processing With Forestry</title>

      <guid>https://forestry.io/blog/how-to-use-hugo-s-image-processing-with-forestry/</guid>
      <description>0.32 update introduced built-in image processing for certain assets. One limitation of this feature is that it only works for page resources, which are page-relative assets stored alongside your posts in the content/ directory of your site. Since Forestryâs uploads are stored in the static/uploads/ directory by default, these assets cannot be resized in your templates using Hugoâs built-in resizer. This document will provide a step-by-step guide for working around this limitation.</description>

      <description>Picture this: it&amp;rsquo;s 2018, and your client needs an online store. You know that static sites are great: they&amp;rsquo;re easy to scale, have a minimal attack surface, and are very fast. However, since a static site can&amp;rsquo;t run backend code, it won&amp;rsquo;t be able to do some things necessary for e-commerce, such as process customer orders. Can you really use a static site to operate an e-commerce storefront?
Of course you can!</description>

      <title>What&#39;s New in Jekyll 3.8</title>

      <guid>https://forestry.io/blog/what-s-new-in-jekyll-3.8/</guid>
      <description>Whatâs new in Jekyll 3.8 Jekyll 3.8.1 was released on the 1st of May 2018, just two weeks after 3.8.0. The project has come a long way since I last wrote a Jekyll update on Forestry. Olivia is now Jekyllâs new Lead Developer since Parker Moore decided to step down after four years leading the project.
So what does Jekyll bring us this time?
Performance optimizations Large sites containing a huge amount of posts are going to see a massive reduction in their total build times especially if they are doing multiple calls to the where filter with the same input and property parameter.</description>

      <description>Part of our mission at Forestry is to dissolve the perceived limitations of static sites. In reality, static sites are easy to understand and integrate with, and the belief that static sites are not capable of feature X is largely a failure of imagination. With a little cleverness and determination, virtually anything is possible on a static platform.
Previously, we showed you how to set up Algolia with Jekyll as well as with Hugo to make your content searchable.</description>

      <description>Create React App is a utility provided by the Facebook team in support of the React JavaScript framework. The goal of Create React App is to allow developers to quickly bootstrap a React project without having to spend time sorting out the build pipeline. With over 47,000 stars on Github (over half as many as the actual React library,) Create React App&amp;rsquo;s popularity speaks for itself.
The success and utility of Create React App has inspired the Forestry.</description>

      <description>When it comes to creating websites, good content strategy is all about turning ideas into HTML with a minimal amount of friction. Whether using a CMS with a web interface or editing content files for a static site generator, content creators need an easy way to create visually interesting and well-structured content.
Every approach is a compromise between flexibility and ease-of-use. Even if a developer could anticipate all of a content creator&amp;rsquo;s needs, these needs will change over time.</description>

      <description>Today we introduce Blocks - a powerful Field Type that enables your editors to build entire landing pages from scratch and create rich blog post layouts with a pre-defined code template, we call it a Block Template.
This feature was inspired by CraftCMS&amp;rsquo; Matrix fields and the Wordpress Plugin Advanced Custom Fields.
What is Blocks? Blocks is a Field Type that is made up of multiple templates, so-called Block Templates.</description>

      <description>We are not changing or removing the Markdown WYSIWYG editor. Our Markdown editor will continue to offer both plaintext and WYSIWYG input modes. In fact, removing the HTML WYSIWYG editor will allow us to focus on making the Markdown editor even better.
 The HTML WYSIWYG Editor has proven to be less and less the state-of-the-art content editing experience it once set out to be. Considering the issues the HTML WYSIWYG Editor causes and the merits Markdown provides we made the decision to discontinue our WYSIWYG HTML Editor on 5/11/2018.</description>

      <description>As developers, we love open and accessible data. For example, you may want to use your local transit data for a mobile app, or maybe you want a service like Zapier or IFTTT to send you an email every time the weather forecast calls for rain. If youâre a super geek like @bdougieyo, youâve built an app that tells you when to leave work in order to avoid traffic from your local baseball teamâs home games (from his excellent talk here).</description>

      <description>Choosing the right tools to build a website isnât easy these days. Thereâs just too many options! Building a static site is one of these options, which comes with many advantages like top-notch security, blazingly-fast performance, and reduced costs.
When it comes to building static sites, the two leading solutions right now are Hugo and Jekyll. So the question is, which is right for you?
To answer that question, weâll take a look at the features, speed, and extensibility of each, looking for the pros and the cons of both generators.</description>

      <description>A Guest is a single-site user with limited permissions. Guests do not get access to support and are often used for clients or external colleagues.
A Guest can only access the site that you invite them to, whereas your team (available to those on the Business Plan) can access all of your sites.
Each site can have up to 3 Guest accounts.

Attempting to learn and keep up with these tools takes time and energy that you would rather devote to your project. Reducing cognitive overhead is a core component of Forestry.io&amp;rsquo;s philosophy â we designed a static site CMS that is easy to set up and use.</description>

      <description>When I view an error log from Forestry I see: Could not locate Gemfile or .bundle/ directory What this error means Gemfiles include a list of project dependencies and where to find them. Bundler is a dependency manager for the Ruby programming language that can read Gemfiles, resolve the dependency graph and install those gems. Jekyll is a ruby application and can use Bundler to manage your project dependencies. Forestry requires that your Jekyll projects contain a Gemfile at the root of the repository.</description>

 Hugo and Jekyll are the leading static site generators according to StaticGen.com, and both supported by our CMS. We&amp;rsquo;re often asked which tool performs better so we decided to do an analysis.
TL;DR We ran two tests to measure build times with Hugo and Jekyll. The basic test used the default installation of Jekyll and Hugo to build sites with 10 posts,100 posts, 1,000 posts and 10,000 posts.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve got great improvements to share with you fromÂ Forestry.io, involving Forestryâs Media Library.
The Media Library allows content editors to easily upload images, videos, and much more without needing to understand Git.
Single Upload Directory We&amp;rsquo;ve received a lot of feedback from the community about which media should be displayed in the media library.
Forestry used to display media from all folders throughout the project. Not all of these folders are useful for your editors, and resulted in theme assets, favicons, and other media being displayed.</description>

 Your content files are improperly formatted. Your layout files are improperly formatted or have a build error. Our service messed up. Our bad.  We output the error the caused the import to fail and allow you to view it in order to help you debug.</description>

      <description>For some hosting providers (such as GitHub pages) you will need to place a CNAME file in the root of your site.
You&amp;rsquo;ll need to ensure that the CNAME file is treated as a static file, so that it is copied to the root of your site during the build.
Make sure you place your CNAME file in your source directory, not your build directory. Otherwise it will be deleted during the next build</description>

      <description>Sometimes youâll find your assets arenât loading when you preview or publish your site. This is almost always due to path issues.
The best way to solve this issue is to ensure you&amp;rsquo;re always allowing your SSG (Static Site Generator) to generate URLs.
For example, we have a CSS file named main.css that isnât loading when viewing subpages.
In the dev environment, weâre serving the site from localhost:4000, meaning that main.</description>

      <description>Letting developers import a site from a zip archive is a feature that a lot of our users have made use of. However, with our strong focus on Git-backed workflows, we feel that that sites imported with zips have been providing a unsatisfactory experience.
At Forestry, we believe Git-backed content management systems are the future of content management, and that using a Git repository is the best way to manage sites.</description>

      <description>Introducing Forestry Config Files Last month we released a big update to Front Matter Templates, which provided an unprecedented level of control over the user interface content editors use to edit their Hugo and Jekyll sites with.
Today weâre introducing a new feature to equally empower developers: Forestry Config Files.
Config files allow developers to create and manage the settings and Front Matter Templates of a site directly in the Git Repo.</description>

WYSIWYG Formatting in Textareas Our textarea Front Matter field has been upgraded to allow for WYSIWYG input. Enjoy being able to add bold, italic, underline, and code formatting.
Enable WYSIWYG for Textareas You can enable the WYSIWYG features by enabling the âWYSIWYGâ toggle on any textarea Front Matter field.

      <description>For Hugo users a few great updates came out recently with a long-awaited feature:Â nested sections. Along with nested sections, Hugo 0.22-0.24 added a series of improvements that make building websites even easier.
Nested Sections, Whatâs The Big Deal? If youâre not familiar with Hugo, sections are the different types of content your Hugo site has. For example Posts, Pages, and Press Releases.
Until Hugo 0.22, nesting sections werenât supported as a feature, meaning you couldnât easily have a hierarchical relationship between different types of content.</description>

Weâve also made collaboration more powerful by making drafts shared. If you make changes to a document without publishing, the rest of your team will see these changes when they view the page.</description>

      <description>Jekyll 3.4.0 was release on the 27th of January 2017 with some noteworthy enhancements that I&amp;rsquo;d like to share with you.
So what&amp;rsquo;s new?
Add connector param to âarray_to_sentence_stringâ filter  array - The list of strings to join. string - A string can be any text inside quotes. In this example I will use Jekyll tags. connector - The word placed before the last word in the array. The default connector Jekyll uses is the word âandâ.</description>

      <description>Does the following sound familiar?Â You set up a WP site, hand it off to a non-dev, and then they point to some unused part of the UI and say:
 &#34;What does this do?&#34;
 To which you sheepishly reply:
 &#34;Oh, that doesn&#39;t do anything...just ignore it.&#34;
 A CMS often feels like a work-around, designed for some other purpose.
Front Matter Templates (FMTs) FMTs allow you to customize the presentation of your UI fields in your CMS.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been a GitLab user since their very first release in Oct of 2011. I worked at a design agency and converted everything over from SVN to Git and used an internal GitLab installation.

      <description>When it comes to the Internet, content is king. A site that has well written content concisely tells the story behind a brand, helps to inform customers about a business&amp;rsquo; products or services and helps guide a user navigate to the information that they seek.
I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with various organizations in helping them choose the technology that is used to publish content onto their sites. When it came down to making a choice, the publishing platform options were often slimmed down by the need for non-technical users to easily publish content.</description>

      <description>My friend, Emily, needed a simple website for her restaurant. She&amp;rsquo;s a chef and didn&amp;rsquo;t want to deal with the hassle of DNS, hosting, design, etc. As a recovering freelancer, I offered to help.
Normally, I would use WordPress for a site like this, but I was fed up with the headaches that comes with maintaining a WordPress site. So, I took an evening and cranked out a simple 1-page static site.</description>
