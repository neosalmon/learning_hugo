      <description>Back in April we announced a feature that we believed was a game-changer for static site content managers. Blocks was here to introduce a way for you to put together sites using pre-composed site snippets inside Forestry.
While we did our best to show you how to set them up and give you an idea of how powerful they could be, we noticed that getting to know Blocks and figuring out how to set them up from scratch wasn&amp;rsquo;t as self-explanatory as we had hoped.</description>

      <description>Hugo makes it super easy to build simple APIs with its built-in output formats. In my previous article, we built a fully functional JSON API. Today we‚Äôre going to extend the capabilities of this API and improve the user experience with better URLs.
At the moment our API can look up specific items, but can‚Äôt look at them in relation to each other. Say you want to know what players are in a specific team: with our current API, you can&amp;rsquo;t do that easily.</description>

      <description>When it comes to creating websites, good content strategy is all about turning ideas into HTML with a minimal amount of friction. Whether using a CMS with a web interface or editing content files for a static site generator, content creators need an easy way to create visually interesting and well-structured content.
Every approach is a compromise between flexibility and ease-of-use. Even if a developer could anticipate all of a content creator&amp;rsquo;s needs, these needs will change over time.</description>

      <description>As developers, we love open and accessible data. For example, you may want to use your local transit data for a mobile app, or maybe you want a service like Zapier or IFTTT to send you an email every time the weather forecast calls for rain. If you‚Äôre a super geek like @bdougieyo, you‚Äôve built an app that tells you when to leave work in order to avoid traffic from your local baseball team‚Äôs home games (from his excellent talk here).</description>

 This article is part of our on-going Frontend Friday modern web development series
Tools like Hugo, Jekyll, and Gatsby have made building static sites a popular and practical choice for developers. One major disadvantage these tools have, however, is the need to regenerate and redeploy their files every time there is new content to publish.</description>

      <description>For this week on Frontend Friday, we&amp;rsquo;ll be covering how to set up lightning ‚ö°Ô∏è fast search for your Hugo site using Algolia, the SaaS (Search as a Service üòâ ) provider. We published a Jekyll-focused version of this guide last week.
Algolia&amp;rsquo;s self-proclaimed claim-to-fame is that they are&amp;ldquo;the most reliable platform for building search into your business,&amp;rdquo; and honestly, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to disagree. Forestry&amp;rsquo;s search is powered by Algolia (just try searching for Algolia in the search above!</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve also compared Jekyll &amp;amp; Hugo features across 6 dimensions. Learn More
 Hugo and Jekyll are the leading static site generators according to StaticGen.com, and both supported by our CMS. We&amp;rsquo;re often asked which tool performs better so we decided to do an analysis.
TL;DR We ran two tests to measure build times with Hugo and Jekyll. The basic test used the default installation of Jekyll and Hugo to build sites with 10 posts,100 posts, 1,000 posts and 10,000 posts.</description>

      <description>For Hugo users a few great updates came out recently with a long-awaited feature:¬†nested sections. Along with nested sections, Hugo 0.22-0.24 added a series of improvements that make building websites even easier.
Nested Sections, What‚Äôs The Big Deal? If you‚Äôre not familiar with Hugo, sections are the different types of content your Hugo site has. For example Posts, Pages, and Press Releases.
Until Hugo 0.22, nesting sections weren‚Äôt supported as a feature, meaning you couldn‚Äôt easily have a hierarchical relationship between different types of content.</description>
