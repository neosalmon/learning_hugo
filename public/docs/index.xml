      <title>Storing Media Files</title>

      <description>Forestry provides multiple options for media storage.
Git The most basic option for storing media is to commit it to your git repo like the rest of your content. This is the default setting for new projects.
If your site has a large number of media files, we highly recommend you select a different storage option. Very large git repos are slower to clone and work with and will not present an optimal development experience.</description>
